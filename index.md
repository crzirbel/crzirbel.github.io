Hello! Welcome to my website. I am a postdoc at the University of Minnesota and Cedar Creek LTER.

I am currently working with Forest Isbell and Dave Tilman asking how grazing by bison reduces fire intensity and competition from
dominant grasses to promote oak regeneration and the diversity of savanna species.

My research broadly focuses on how plant functional traits structure the assembly of plant communities and functioning of ecosystems
undergoing restoration. Focusing on improving restoration success by applying knowledge from basic ecology research while also
using restoration as a system to test community ecology and diversity-ecosystem function theory.
