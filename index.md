Hello! Welcome to my website. I am an ecologist interested in the causes and consequences of global biodiversity change.

In my research I use large-scale observational and experimental studies to ask how ecological interactions, including global change, large grazers, small mammals, and functional traits, alter the assembly of plant communities and how theses plant assemblages provide ecosystem functions.

For more information, please check out my [Research](https://crzirbel.github.io/Research.html) and [Publications](https://crzirbel.github.io/publications.html) pages.
